# SEDS-Lab-Coding-Challenge

The code in this project turns a human-readable list of requirements into JSON. See the Example folder for sample input and JSON output.

There are Python and Java versions of the code. See the Java folder for instructions on how to compile and run the Java files. There is only one Python file, so to execute the Python code just run it.
